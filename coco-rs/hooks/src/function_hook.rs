//! In-process function hooks.
//!
//! Function hooks are in-memory callbacks that evaluate a predicate over
//! the current message history when their event fires. Unlike the four
//! settings-loaded handler types
//! ([`HookHandler::Command`](super::HookHandler::Command) /
//! [`Prompt`](super::HookHandler::Prompt) /
//! [`Http`](super::HookHandler::Http) /
//! [`Agent`](super::HookHandler::Agent)) which deserialize from
//! `settings.json`, function hooks are **registered in code** during
//! session bootstrap and live only for the lifetime of the session.
//!
//! They are stored in a separate field on [`crate::HookRegistry`] rather
//! than as a new variant on [`HookHandler`] — the latter would break
//! `Serialize` / `Deserialize` round-tripping of settings-derived hooks.
//!
//! ## Use cases
//!
//! 1. **`StructuredOutput` Stop enforcement** — prevent Stop until the
//!    model successfully calls the `StructuredOutput` tool. Wired in
//!    [`coco_tools::register_structured_output_tool`] and friends.
//! 2. **Swarm teammate init** — block Stop until team config is
//!    acknowledged. (Pending port.)
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! Predicates are synchronous but [`crate::orchestration`] drives them
//! via [`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`] so a CPU-heavy predicate can't
//! starve the tokio runtime, bounded by [`tokio::time::timeout`] with
//! the hook's configured timeout.

/// drives execution from arbitrary tokio worker threads. `Debug` is
/// load-bearing — registry diagnostics print this value when a hook
/// fires.
///
/// Implementations are conventionally **pure**: no I/O, no mutation of
/// shared state. If state is required, the predicate type can hold an
/// `Arc<Mutex<…>>` field and use interior mutability — but doing so is
/// an antipattern for the common case (predicates are pure scans

    /// running until `evaluate` returns — `spawn_blocking` cannot
    /// interrupt synchronous code. The hook is reported as failed
    /// (block-Stop semantics) but the predicate thread leaks until it
    /// returns. A predicate that hangs indefinitely leaks an OS
    /// thread for the lifetime of the process.
